                    Thank you so much for beings interested in my art!
                    I’d love to create for you. Let’s talk through
                    pricing and move along to the process.

                        These are great as social media icons but can
                        be used for anything!

                <h1>How Commissions Work</h1>
                <p>
                    Once you’ve contacted me and we’ve discussed your
                    ideas, we have a detailed plan, and payment has
                    been sent, I’ll start on the preliminary sketch.
                    Once that’s finished, I’ll send it to you. If
                    anything needs to be edited, this would be the
                    time to let me know. I’ll edit the sketch up to
                    two times. I’ll do the line art and coloring.
                    Before I add finishing touches, I’ll have you look
                    over it once more and will edit the colors one
                    time if need be. Once I get the okay, I’ll
                    complete the portrait and email you the full file
                    of both the finished piece and the line art (so
                    you can print it out and color it). And hooray!!
                    You have a custom art work.
